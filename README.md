# Expo Camera takePictureAsync Error: Camera Not Initialized

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the Expo Camera API's `takePictureAsync` method. The error arises when attempting to use `takePictureAsync` before the camera has finished initializing.  This typically results in a runtime error indicating that the camera object is null or undefined.

## Problem

The `Camera` component in Expo requires some time to load and prepare before it is ready to capture images.  If `takePictureAsync` is called immediately after the component renders or before the camera is fully initialized, an error will occur.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that `takePictureAsync` is only called after the camera has successfully initialized. This is typically accomplished using asynchronous operations and state management to track the camera's readiness.
